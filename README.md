# Real-Time-Rendering
I am very glad to tell you that I have joined a course at [**"ASTROMEDICOMP"**](http://astromedicomp.org/) for [**Real Time Rendering/OpenGL**](http://astromedicomp.org/opengl/course/) where currently I am also attending the course of [**UNIX System Design**](http://astromedicomp.org/course/unix/). In this course we will be taught Real Time Rendering using OpenGL on Windows, Linux, MAC OS-X by both fixed function & Programmable pipelines, OpenGL ES on Android and iOS, WEB-GL on web platform, Direct X on Windows desktop and mobile platforms. I would also like to tell you that all the programs in this repository on **"Real Time Rendering/OpenGL"** are the part of assignments given to us by [**Dr. Vijay Gokhale**](http://astromedicomp.org/dr-vijay-gokhale/).


## Index
As I have joined the course recently we haven't been assigned with much work. But I assure you that as soon as we will be assigned with the work I will be updating the index and the repository as the time comes. You will get the steps that you need to perform on your system to run those programs on your system in every derictory from the index.

## Prerequisites
Now if you want to get the programs running on your system you should have this things on it. Don't worry if you don't have this softwares on your system I will tell you how to install those on your system. But if your system doesn't meet the software requirements then there is nothing much that I can do other than saying sorry. So by clearing these things lets get our hands dirty.
