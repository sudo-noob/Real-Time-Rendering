# Real-Time-Rendering
I am very glad to tell you that I have joined a course at [ASTROMEDICOMP](http://astromedicomp.org/) for [Real Time Rendering/OpenGL](http://astromedicomp.org/opengl/course/) where currently I am also attending the course of [UNIX System Design](http://astromedicomp.org/course/unix/). I would also like to tell you that all the programs in this repository on "Real Time Rendering/OpenGL" are the part of assignments given to us by [Dr. Vijay Gokhale](http://astromedicomp.org/dr-vijay-gokhale/).
